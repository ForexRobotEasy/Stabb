# Stabb.mq5

This code is for an Expert Advisor (EA) called Stabb, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in the product.

## Description

Stabb is an EA that utilizes stochastic signals to make trading decisions. It checks if the main stochastic line crosses the overbought or oversold levels and intersects with the signal line. Based on these conditions, it generates buy or sell signals. Additionally, it checks for price movements against the initial order and opens additional orders if necessary.

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the EA initialization process. It is responsible for initializing necessary variables and indicators. In this code, it simply returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is being shut down. It performs any necessary cleanup tasks. In this code, no specific cleanup tasks are implemented.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the EA that is called on every tick. It checks if the stochastic lines cross the overbought or oversold levels and intersect with the signal line. If these conditions are met, it generates buy or sell signals. Additionally, it checks for price movements against the initial order and opens additional orders if required.

## Custom Indicator Functions

The EA uses three custom indicator functions to determine trading signals based on the stochastic lines.

- `CrossesOverbought()`: This function checks if the main stochastic line crosses the overbought level. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

- `CrossesOversold()`: This function checks if the main stochastic line crosses the oversold level. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

- `IntersectsSignalLine()`: This function checks if the main stochastic line intersects with the signal line. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

## Trading Functions

The EA includes three trading functions to execute buy and sell trades, as well as open additional orders.

- `Sell()`: This function implements the logic to perform a sell trade. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

- `Buy()`: This function implements the logic to perform a buy trade. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

- `OpenAdditionalOrders()`: This function implements the logic to open additional orders if the price moves against the initial order. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code.
